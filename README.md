Clinical data mining and classification - Master's thesis project

The requirements.txt file lists all but one Python packages this work depends on. They can be installed using the following command: 

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The additional package (https://github.com/jundongl/scikit-feature) was not shared on pip installs packages (PIP), therefore it has to be installed individually (by cloning or downloading the zip file).
